# ANALYZING-ELECTRIC-VEHICLE-CHARGING-HABITS-USING-SQL

Completed a SQL project analyzing EV charging behavior in modern apartment buildings — a perfect mix of sustainability, tech, and data!

Using a PostgreSQL dataset of charging sessions, I explored how tenants use shared EV charging stations, when demand spikes, and which charging habits lead to the most competition for ports.

With EV adoption rising, understanding these patterns is key for apartment managers planning infrastructure upgrades. It was a great opportunity to apply SQL to a real-world emerging technology challenge.

This SQL project analyzes EV charging session data stored in a PostgreSQL database.

Using the charging_sessions table, I queried usage patterns, explored peak demand times, compared charging behavior across tenants, and identified potential bottlenecks in shared charging station availability.

The insights help apartment building managers improve policies, optimize port allocation, and plan for growing EV adoption.
